## Society
Mordoth is mostly inhabited by Humans and Dwarves. The imperialism of Mordoth is what gave them the reputation as the mightiest country of Magia, boasting the best infantry to ever exist. Talan is home to the highly-acclaimed Academy of Blades, many great swordmen of time have attended and honed their skills there. The strict laws of Mordoth reduce much crime in the country, but that does not mean it is free of it. Several towns that are such poor-ridden, the folks result to thievery to feed themselves, even if they see the rest of their lives behind bars. 
It seems that they are much a gated community, as they do not take kindly to any other race that is not a Human or a Dwarf. The one exception I found to this unspoken rule is if one were attending the Academy of Blades. Only then would they be recognized as an equal to Humans and Dwarves.

## Geography
Mordoth is mostly made up of forests and mountains, with an access port to the Sound of Patlabor. Much of the south of Mordoth is uninhabitable due to the high density of mana in its forests, creating Leshens. Their overpopulation is kept in check, however, via the Academy of Blades' efforts. To the north of Mordoth is the Dragon's Lip, located close to the empire. Wyvern attacks are not uncommon to see in this country and are swiftly taken care of by the Mordoth Militia.

## Economics
Unlike most of Magia, Mordoth adopts its own currency. Dating all the way back the country's founding, the Sharyn Currency consists of green coins with a face of an elvish woman on the front and a lavish castle on the back. The castle does not seem to represent the current palace of Mordoth, so the questions of who the woman is or what the castle represents remain unanswered. The material used for the Sharyn Currency can be charged with mana, giving a green glow around the coin. The purpose is yet unknown but gives it worth in currency exchange. One Sharyn coin is half the worth of a Magian Gold, or five times the worth of a Magian Silver, or 50 times the worth of a Magian Copper.
Mordoth has a variable amount of sources when it comes to sources of income. Mining, trading with Korona, Leshen slaying and harvest, just to name a few. Despite the tensions with Lyrias and Zeth, Mordoth manages to keep up ties with the west end of the continent.

## Politics
Mordoth is a monarchy. The entirety of Mordoth is under rule by emperor Blitz Elrond. The militaristic aura of Mordoth is enough to strike fear into the worst of criminals. Laws are enforced by the militia themselves and severe punishment awaits those that dare toy with the laws. Some of these punishments results in debts too large to pay off in a lifetime, resulting in being sold off to slavery. But no matter how grim it may look, Blitz's charisma strikes pride and courage to any person he faces. It is almost uncanny how unified Mordoth seems.

## Origins
Mordoth is one of the oldest countries in Magia. Dating back to the First Omnimachy, they formed in A480. The strongest soldiers of Magia formed together to protect the lands they know as home. "To hell with those monsters, I would rather die keeping our sacred Ethria from them before I submit any defeat!", a famous line of an unnamed soldier that sparks courage and morale in the hearts of Mordoth citizens. In a hasty decision, they established a base that came to be known as "Mordoth Wall". This would later develop into becoming a city into a country.
