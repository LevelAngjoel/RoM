Many a time have there been rumors or sightings of a supposed "Voidwalker". At each ends of our world is said to be endless void. Those that cross from beyond the void were said to be "Voidwalkers". Nothing is known of who these Voidwalkers could be or their reason for crossing, if the legends of the Voidwalkers were to be fact that is. It is said that they posses immense strength, superior magic, unusual abilities, or something of the like. Some say that the second Hero of the Sword, Deedlit, was a Voidwalker due to her unnatural spellcasting abilities.
