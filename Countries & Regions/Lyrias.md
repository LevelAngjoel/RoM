## Society
Lyrias is mostly a Human and Dwarf dominated country. Considering the historic bond between Humans and Dwarves, Lyrias is built upon that strong bond without the harsh militaristic codes and laws of Mordoth. Lyrias also recognizes the other races of Magia within its borders. It also is a main source for those to enjoy the culture of Dwarves to thrive and experience without the harsh conditions of the Dragon's Lip. There are risks of crime that may happen if you wander into the wrong parts of the kingdom, but they are very avoidable if you are aware of where you are. 
The most unique aspect you may find in this country is the abundant slavery of Kobolds. Due to their natural ability to dig efficiently, they have been used for labor relating to mining expeditions. It seems to be common in this country, despite the views that other territories may have about the idea.

## Geography
Lyrias' environment consists of mountains, grassland, and forests. There is a large river that cuts across Lyrias that separates itself from the Dragon's Lip. The dangerous creatures and monsters of Dragon's Lip are unable to cross this river and aids in keeping the country safe from danger. The river itself is mostly safe to live near but cases of monsters from the river have been reported to appear and terrorize local towns.
The climate of Lyrias is mostly temperate, with Hotto being the main city to be a mostly farming area of the country that shares the same climate calendar as Zeth. The climate of Lyrias makes almost anyone from each corners of the world able to live in it. 

## Economics
Lyrias adopts the Magian Currency of Copper, Silver, and Gold. Travel between Lyrias and Zeth is much easier with the shared currency and rids the need for currency exchange. Much of the labor here is mostly between mining and lumber work. There exists work in trade, but it is not as prominent as in Zeth or Arlon. There is much competition in the mining field as major hauls of mana crystals are met with generous rewards.  The mountains of Dragon's Lip stretch underground to Lyrias and harbor mana in the stone. Due to this, mana crystals form and are a valuable resource in magic research. This doesn't rid the dangers in the caverns of the Dragon's Lip. The lumber work, on the other hand, is not as dangerous as mining mana crystals. While still having to worry about Leshens, it is much more manageable than cave monsters. 

## Politics
Lyrias is a monarchy. The Kingdom of Lyrias is under rule by current queen Lynn Lyrias. She was born a benedict, or one blessed with special powers or abilities. The benedict gave her an exceptional increase in intelligence, which allowed her to supersede both the former King and Queen of Lyrias. breaking away from tradition, Lynn became the first monarch to rule without a King. Many of the laws in Lyrias protects its citizens and workers, but not the Kobolds. Some of the laws prevent citizens from going a certain distance towards Mordoth or be branded a traitor to the Lyrias Kingdom. Passage to Mordoth is virtually impossible from Lyrias due to these laws. Punishment for breaking these laws results in lifetime prison or made an example in the kingdom's public square.  

## Origins
In the height of the Mordoth civil war in A935, a man named Luce Lyrias led a rebellion against Mordoth and, at the end of the civil war, split away from the country. He founded the country of Lyrias that wouldn't be oppressed or abused in favor of an overpowering military. While they faced hunt parties sent by Mordoth to seek the rebellion and put an end to them, Luce continued to take his stance and defend the rebellion and the country.  Over the years, Lyrias and Mordoth would continue to have political tensions that seem like they will never quell.
